    <string name="intro_text3">To top it off, you’ve been single for over 10 years.</string>
    <string name="intro_text4">Suddenly, a revelation hits you.</string>
    <string name="intro_text5">You live in the magical land of poutine, Poutineland, governed by Sir Vladimir Poutine.</string>

    <string name="game2_result1text">As you approach the giant cheese, it starts pelting cheese curds at you.</string>
    <string name="game2_result1right">You hold up your wooden spoon in defense…</string>
    <string name="game2_result1wrong">You hold up your plastic spoon in defense…</string>
    <string name="game2_result1right1">Boom, boom! Your wooden spoon looks like it’s just barely enough to shield you from its attacks.</string>
    <string name="game2_result1right2">You better start attacking before it breaks!</string>
    <string name="game2_result1wrong1">SNAP! Your plastic spoon was smashed into little pieces.</string>
    <string name="game2_result1wrong2">The last thing you see is the cheese monster slowly approaching…</string>

    <string name="game2_result2wrong2">The last thing you see is the cheese monster slowly approaching…</string>

    <string name="game2_result3text">The cheese is staggering from the pain of its wounds.</string>
    <string name="game2_result3right">You take out your blow torch to deliver the final blow.</string>
    <string name="game2_result3wrong">You take out your lemon juice to deliver the final blow.</string>
    <string name="game2_result3wrong1">Spritz, spritz! The lemon juice trickles down the cheese without affecting it.</string>
    <string name="game2_result3wrong2">The last thing you see is the cheese monster slowly approaching…</string>
